	     <p>Hopefully, you've heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_to_Apples">Apples to Apples</a>. If not, then I hope you've heard of apples, because those are just as good. But like most good things in life, there comes a time when evil spreads its roots faster than you can grab a can of pesticide. And when that happens, the bell strikes, the cuckoos sound, your uncle barges out from the bedroom frantically trying to put pants on, and the apples turn <em>sour</em>.</p>

       <br>

       <p>Much like Apples to Apples, maybe you've turned sour too. It's called growing up. Your childhood fears of getting your lunch money away are replaced by actually getting your money taken away. You wake up every morning and everybody looks like Hitler. In addition, you are hungry, homeless, have three children, and both your wife and husband left you for another man. The children, god, they weren't even yours. </p>

       <br>

       <p>At this point, you should be wondering where this is going, not that it matters. Not that anything <em>really</em> matters. No, really, you should just hit the start button now before I make up more untrue sad things about your hopefully awesome life. </p>

       <br>

       <p>Have fun!</p>
